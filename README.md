# Timeline

A new social network??

## Development

To develop Timeline, you'll need a working Node+Yarn environment, as well as a Docker-compatible container runtime.

```bash
# Clone the repository
gh repo clone GauBen/timeline

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the local Supabase instance
yarn supabase start

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```
